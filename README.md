# A very simple website based on MongoDB CRUD operations. I have used MongoDB to store and retrieve documents. I have added POST, PUT, GET and DELETE methods to manage various operations on the documents.

# Features:

-   The user can see the contacts as cards on the homepage.

-   The user can add contacts information on the add contacts route and the cards will automatically be added to the contact list and shown in the homepage.

-   The user can add the contacts as favorites by clicking on the favorites button on the cards.

-   The user can update the contact information by clicking on the update button on the cards.

-   The user can delete the contact by clicking on the delete button on the cards.
